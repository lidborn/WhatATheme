In the following post, I'll be presenting the process of how I, along with a group of friends, came together during a week to create the Ludum Dare game, "Kappetalize!" This article will delve into our experiences and insights during the creation process. The game jam duration  lasts for half a week so dont judge the bugs to harshly!
